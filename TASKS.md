# Project Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks required to implement the sales invoice management system as described in the DESIGN.md file. The tasks are organized by component and priority to guide the development process.

## Backend Development Tasks (Django + DRF)

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Django project with Django REST Framework
- [x] Configure settings.py with database, static files, and middleware
- [x] Set up project structure (apps, settings, urls)
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL database connection

### 2. Authentication System
- [ ] Implement JWT token authentication
- [ ] Create User model (if extending default Django user)
- [ ] Develop login/logout API endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Secure invoice APIs with authentication

### 3. Invoice Management Module
- [x] Create Invoice model
- [x] Create InvoiceItem model
- [x] Implement model relationships and constraints
- [ ] Add validation for unique reference numbers
- [ ] Implement auto-calculation of total amounts
- [ ] Add validation for at least one invoice item

### 4. Transaction Module
- [x] Create Transaction model
- [x] Implement relationship with Invoice model
- [ ] Add transaction type validation (Sale, Payment)
- [ ] Implement automatic transaction creation logic

### 5. Invoice API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement GET /api/invoices/ (List all invoices)
- [ ] Implement POST /api/invoices/ (Create new invoice)
- [ ] Implement GET /api/invoices/{id}/ (Retrieve invoice details)
- [ ] Implement PUT /api/invoices/{id}/ (Update invoice)
- [ ] Implement PATCH /api/invoices/{id}/mark-paid/ (Mark invoice as paid)
- [ ] Add validation for invoice status before payment
- [ ] Add validation for negative totals

### 6. Transaction API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement GET /api/transactions/ (List all transactions)
- [ ] Implement GET /api/transactions/{id}/ (Retrieve transaction details)

### 7. Business Logic Implementation
- [ ] Implement auto-calculation of invoice totals from items
- [ ] Add validation to ensure invoice has at least one item
- [ ] Implement payment status update logic
- [ ] Add validation for pending status before allowing payment
- [ ] Ensure totals always match with items

### 8. Database Migrations
- [x] Create initial migrations for all models
- [x] Apply migrations to database
- [x] Create superuser for admin access

### 9. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for invoice creation
- [ ] Write unit tests for invoice payment
- [ ] Test validation rules
- [ ] Test authentication security
- [ ] Test transaction recording logic

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create README with API usage instructions
- [ ] Document database schema

## Frontend Development Tasks (ReactJS + TypeScript)

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize ReactJS project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure project structure
- [ ] Set up routing
- [ ] Install required dependencies

### 2. Authentication Components
- [ ] Create login form component
- [ ] Implement JWT token storage
- [ ] Create authentication context/service
- [ ] Add protected routes

### 3. Invoice Components
- [ ] Create invoice creation form
- [ ] Implement invoice list view (table)
- [ ] Create invoice detail view
- [ ] Add mark as paid button
- [ ] Implement form validation

### 4. API Integration
- [ ] Create API service for invoices
- [ ] Create API service for transactions
- [ ] Implement authentication API calls
- [ ] Connect components to backend APIs

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add responsive design
- [ ] Create consistent styling

## Deployment & Finalization Tasks

### 1. Final Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of all features
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (for frontend)

### 2. Documentation
- [ ] Finalize API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Prepare demo instructions

### 3. Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Prepare production settings
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure static file serving
- [ ] Prepare database for production

### 4. Demo Preparation
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Prepare presentation materials
- [ ] Test all demo scenarios
- [ ] Verify GitHub repository is complete

## Priority Levels

### High Priority
1. Project setup (Django + React)
2. Authentication implementation
3. Invoice model creation
4. Basic invoice CRUD APIs
5. Transaction recording logic

### Medium Priority
1. Frontend invoice components
2. API integration
3. Validation implementation
4. Testing
5. Documentation

### Low Priority
1. UI/UX enhancements
2. Advanced features
3. Performance optimizations
4. Extended documentation

## Dependencies

- Django project must be set up before implementing models
- Authentication must be implemented before securing APIs
- Models must be created before implementing APIs
- Backend APIs must be available before frontend integration
- Testing can be done in parallel with development
